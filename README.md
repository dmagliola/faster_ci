# faster_ci

This is a supplementary repo to my RailsConf 2021 talk 
["Speed up your test suite by throwing computers at it"](https://railsconf.com/program/sessions#session-1117)  

Here you can find all the code examples mentioned in the talk, the slides deck, and some 
more resources.

Most of this code will require some modification for you to use, but i've documented this 
at the top of each file to try and make that easier.

I'm open to issues and PRs if you find improvements to make to these!
